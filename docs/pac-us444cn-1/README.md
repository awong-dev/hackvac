# Logs from PACUS444CN-1

These are packet logs from the PACUS444CN-1 communication with a PVAA36AA4	
ducted heatpump.

Logs taken from a Saleae logic analyizer. Pin5 is the RX and Pin4 is the TX.

See the `extracted_packets` directory for a slightly cleaned up version of
the data that's organized by packet rather than by byte-stream.
